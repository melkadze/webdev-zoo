# webdev-zoo

### Description

This repository is my first assignment for "Intro to Web Development" -- a zoo!

It features four animals with their own pages, which each include:
* A title
* An image
* A three-line description
* A navigation link to go back to the homepage
* A custom background color based on the animal
